Used-Car-Price-Prediction

The main motive here is to predict the selling price of cars based on the specifications and features. We have a dataset of past history of cars listed by specification and their corresponding prices.

Using that data, we built a model to best approximate the relationship between the features and response variables to generate predictions.

This is a classic regresion problem where the response is the price of the car and the features are its specifications.
