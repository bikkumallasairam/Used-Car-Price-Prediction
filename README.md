# Used Car Price Prediction
The main motive here is to predict the selling price of cars based on the specifications and features. We have a dataset of past history of cars listed by specification and their corresponding prices.

Using that data, we built a model to best approximate the relationship between the features and response variables to generate predictions.

This is a Regresion problem where the response is the price of the car and the features are its specifications.

## Languages and tools used:
This is completely done in python (v3.6), using jupyterlab for experimentation and the standard libraries used for ML.

## Dataset Source:

## Model:
I have used Linear Regression ,Random Forest,XGboost

## Metrics

Metrics used are R squared, Root mean squared error, Mean Absolute Percentage Error.

For Linear Regression R squrared score is about 76%

4-Fold cross validation is 78 % and Training is score is 82%

For Random Forest R squrared score is about 88%

4-Fold cross validation is 88 % and Training is score is 95%

For XGboost R squrared score is about 86%

 Training is score is 91%
